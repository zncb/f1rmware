Telegraph application for the rad1o badge

This is a basic morse transmitter, able to send and receive messages over RF.

How to use it

Plug your headphones into the rad1o badge. Works better if someone else
installs the app too :)

* Press UP/DOWN to set the carrier frequency
* Press RIGHT/LEFT to set the volume level
* Press ENTER (the joystick) to send some beeps and beeeeeps

Enjoy :)
